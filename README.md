CTF Write Ups
=============

### What is this?
 - I've decided to start to document and do write ups for some of the more interesting flags that I capture within CTFs that I participate in.
 - I've participated in CTFs in the past and didn't do write ups
 - I was inspired to write some up after being mind blown at some of the solutions I found during the AceBear Security Contest in 2019

### Write Ups

## AceBear Security Contest 2019
 - [md5Converter](AceBear%20Security%20Contest%202019/md5Converter/README.md)
   - A simple webapp where you need to exploit a flaw in AES CBC to obtain the flag.
 - [duudududduduud](AceBear%20Security%20Contest%202019/duudududduduud/README.md)
   - A simple webapp where you exploit a different flaw in AES CBC to obtain the flag.

## TSG CTF 2020
 - [Beginner Web](TSG%20CTF%202020/Beginner%20Web/README.md)
   - A code review challenge for a NodeJS server that exploits a flaw with object prototypes and __defineSetter__
